# Theme for Personal Ghost Blog

This repository is the development starter theme for Ghost. Keep changes focused
on theme source, generated assets, CI, and repo-level metadata for this
repository.

## Ghost

### Commands

Use pnpm for this repo, pinned by package.json.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
pnpm test:ci
pnpm zip
```

Run the test command before opening a PR when theme files, generated assets,
dependencies, or CI change.

### Boundaries

- Edit source CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars templates, partials, and package
  metadata intentionally.
- Keep generated assets/built/ files in sync when source assets change and the
  repo tracks those outputs.
- Do not commit node_modules/, local Ghost content, generated zip files outside
  tracked release expectations, or secrets.
- Repo settings, descriptions, and branch rules belong on the GitHub repository;
  internal clean-repos metadata stays in TryGhost/cleanrepos.

## Language

- Use American English spelling, e.g. "color" not "colour".

## Markdown

- Use title case in headings and titles.
- Always use the Oxford comma.
- Use reference-style Markdown links, not inline links.
- Table cells must be single-line. Markdown does not support multi-line cells;
  each newline starts a new row. Ignore line length limits for table rows.

## Version Control

- Never commit directly to `main`, always create a branch or worktree.
- Every commit should be a logical unit of change.
- Every commit must build and pass all checks. Use `just` recipes for
  verification (e.g. `just pre-commit`).
- Fixes and refactoring should be in separate commits from features.
- Each pull request should have one primary commit with a well-crafted
  message — this is what lands in the Git history. Follow-up fixups within
  the same PR can use simple one-liner messages since they get squashed into
  the primary commit on merge.

### Commit Messages

- We use Git as our Version Control System and GitHub to host the code.
- We use pre-commit hooks to verify the changes before committing them.
- We follow this [style guide][git-style-guide] for commit messages:
  - Capitalized, short (50 characters or less) summary in imperative mode
    ("Fix bug", not "Fixed bug")
  - Blank line between summary and body
  - Focus on the "why" — motivation and reasoning — not what changed
  - Minimal formatting or bullet points, plain prose is preferred
  - Full sentences with simple past and present tense
  - Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Don't use backticks in commit message titles, but do use them in bodies.
- **Never** write conventional commit messages.
- **Never** add yourself as a co-author.
